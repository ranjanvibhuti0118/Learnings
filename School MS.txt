Multi-Language/Region Support: Enable language customization and localization based on geography.

Phase 4: Monetization & Subscription Features
Now that the core functionality and advanced features are implemented, itâ€™s time to focus on monetization strategies and offer tiered subscription models.

3. Freemium Model
Provide a free version with very limited features to get schools on board, then charge for premium features or usage beyond certain thresholds.

Phase 5: Continuous Improvement & Scaling
This phase focuses on continuous improvement, scaling, and offering more services to your customers.

Ensure the platform scales well as the number of users (schools, students, teachers) grows.
Implement load balancing, database optimization, and caching techniques.

2. AI and Machine Learning
